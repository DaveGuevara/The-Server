                <p>

                <b>NON-DISCLOSURE / NON-CIRCUMVENTION AGREEMENT</b><br />

                This Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") made this day by and between:<br/><br />



                (1)    Sons of Thunder Productions (the “Creators”); and<br />

                (2)    Internet viewer  (the “Recipient”)<br/><br />



                WHEREAS, the Creators have a proprietary interest in an original concept for a sitcom television series, involving the Creators’ original treatment, music, story line, ideas and characters (the “Property”); and <br />

                WHEREAS, the Recipient desires to obtain access to certain information for the sole purpose of evaluating the Property as an investment and/or for commercial exploitation in the entertainment industry; and<br />

                WHEREAS, the Creators are willing to provide the Recipient with certain information, subject to confidentiality of that information being preserved in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; <br />

                NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants herein contained, the parties agree as follows:<br/><br />



                1. Confidential Information<br />

                (a)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp All information disclosed by the Creators to the Recipient, whether orally or in writing, that relates or refers to the Property, directly or indirectly, shall be deemed confidential and shall constitute Confidential Information.  The Confidential Information shall include <br />

                    (i) all oral or written statements or communications made by the Creators to the Recipient in connection with the Property, <br />

                    (ii) all documents generated by the Recipient which contain, comment upon, or relate in any way to any Confidential Information received from the Creators, and <br />

                    (iii) any written materials relating to the Property provided by the Creators to the Recipient, together with any information derived by the Recipient therefrom.<br />

                (b)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Confidential Information shall not include any information that<br />

                    (i) the Recipient can show by documentary evidence was known to the Recipient prior to the date of its disclosure by the Creators; or <br />

                    (ii) becomes publicly known, by publication or otherwise, not due to any unauthorized act or omission of the Recipient or any other party having an obligation of confidentiality to the Creators; or <br />

                    (iii) is subsequently disclosed by the Creators to any person, firm or corporation on a non-confidential basis; or <br />

                    (iv) the Recipient can conclusively show by documentary evidence that such information was developed independently of any access to the Confidential Information. <br /><br />



                2. Purpose and Limits of Disclosure from Creators to Recipient<br />

                (a)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Creators disclose the Confidential Information to the Recipient solely for the purpose of allowing the Recipient to evaluate the Property and to determine, in its sole discretion, whether the Property has commercial potential such that the Recipient would like to license, purchase, invest in or otherwise assist in the development of the Property.  If the Recipient determines that the Property is suitable for investment or further development, the parties will attempt to agree on a schedule for development, and compensation to the Creators for the Property, for consulting and/or for such other role and/or compensation for the Creators as may be appropriate.<br />

                (b)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Recipient agrees to accept disclosure of the Confidential Information and to exercise the same degree of care to maintain the Confidential Information secret and confidential as it would if the Confidential Information were owned by the Recipient.<br />

                (c)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Creators and shall not be disclosed or revealed by the Recipient to anyone else except employees of the Recipient who have a need to know the information in connection with the Recipient’s evaluation of the Property, and who have entered into a non-disclosure agreement with the Recipient under which such employees are required to keep confidential the Confidential Information and such employees shall be advised by the Recipient of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information.  The Recipient shall be liable for any improper disclosure of the Confidential Information by its employees.<br />

                (d)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Other than as specifically provided in this Agreement, the Recipient will not use the Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever other than for the sole purpose permitted in paragraph 2(a) above, unless and until a further executed agreement is entered into by the parties setting forth the terms and conditions under which rights to the Property and the Confidential Information are to be licensed to, or acquired by, the Recipient.<br />

                (e)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Recipient agrees not to contact, either directly or indirectly, any party other than the Creators (including but not limited to the owner of the Property or any third party who may have an interest in the Property) concerning the Confidential Information without prior written authorization from the Creators.  In the event such authorization is granted, the Recipient shall require such third party to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with the Recipient in connection with the Confidential Information, such agreement to afford the same protection to the Confidential Information as is afforded in this Agreement.<br />

                (f)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Recipient agrees not to use any Confidential Information as a basis upon which to develop or have a third party develop a competing or similar Property, or for any purpose other than the sole purpose set forth in paragraph 2(a) above absent the express written consent of the Creators.  The Recipient agrees not to contact, either directly or indirectly, the owner of the Property or any third party who may have an interest in the Property, concerning the Confidential Information without prior written authorization from the Creators.<br /><br />



                3. Non-Circumvention<br />

                (a)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Recipient agrees not to directly or indirectly contact, deal with, transact or otherwise be involved with any corporation, partnership, individual or other entity introduced by the Creators to the Recipient without the express written permission of the Creators.<br />

                (b)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For a period of three (3) years from the date of this Agreement, the Recipient shall not, without the prior written consent of the Creators, which consent the Creators may withhold in their sole discretion, utilize any Confidential Information to circumvent or compete with the Creators in any exploitation of the Property. <br /><br />



                4. Return of Confidential Information<br />

                The Recipient shall return any and all Confidential Information to the Creators, together with all copies or derivatives thereof and all writings generated by the Recipient in connection with the Recipient’s evaluation of the Property, within five (5) business days after the sooner of (i) the expiration of four (4) weeks from the date of this Agreement, or (ii) the Recipient determines that the Recipient cannot assist in the further development of the Property.<br /><br />



                5. Duration of Recipient’s Non-Disclosure Obligations<br />

                The Recipient’s obligations under paragraph 2 of this Agreement shall extend from the date of this Agreement and shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement in perpetuity, except that the Recipient’s obligations under paragraph 2 above shall terminate immediately in the event that the Creators intentionally disclose the Confidential Information to any third party on a non-confidential basis.<br /><br />



                6. No License; No Assignment<br />

                Nothing contained herein shall be construed as granting or conferring to Recipient any rights by license or otherwise in any Confidential Information. The disclosure and acceptance of the Confidential Information shall not be construed as an offer for sale or purchase of the Property, nor shall same evidence any intent by either party to purchase any goods or services of the other party, nor as an encouragement for the other party to expend funds in development or research efforts.  The Recipient may not assign this Agreement or any interest herein without the express prior written consent of the Creators.<br /><br />



                7. Remedies<br />

                The Recipient acknowledges that the Confidential Information is at all times proprietary to the Creators and that any breach of this Agreement by the Recipient would be harmful to the business interests of the Creators. Consequently, monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach by the Recipient and the Creators shall be entitled to obtain, in addition to any other legal remedies that may be available, such equitable relief as may be necessary to protect the Creators against any such breach.<br /><br />



                8. Modification; No Waiver; Severability<br />

                This Agreement may not be amended except in a writing signed by both parties.  No waiver by either party of any right herein is a waiver of any other right under this Agreement.  If a court finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable as applied to any circumstance, the remainder of this Agreement will be interpreted to carry out the intent of the parties.<br /><br />

 

                9. Governing Law; Venue<br />

                This Agreement is governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, and any dispute hereunder shall be mediated, arbitrated or litigated in the State and City of New York unless otherwise agreed between the parties. <br /><br />

 

                10. Complete Understanding; Notices<br />

                This Agreement expresses the complete understanding of the parties on the subject matter and supersedes all prior proposals, agreements, representations and understandings.
